    <h3>
      Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening, by Robert Frost
    </h3>
    <p>
      Whose woods these are I think I know.   
      His house is in the village though;   
      He will not see me stopping here   
      To watch his woods fill up with snow.   

      My little horse must think it queer   
      To stop without a farmhouse near   
      Between the woods and frozen lake   
      The darkest evening of the year.   

      He gives his harness bells a shake   
      To ask if there is some mistake.   
      The only other sound’s the sweep   
      Of easy wind and downy flake.   

      The woods are lovely, dark and deep,   
      But I have promises to keep,   
      And miles to go before I sleep,   
      And miles to go before I sleep.

    <h3>
      Lines Written in Early Spring, by William Wordsworth
    </h3>
    <p>
      I heard a thousand blended notes,
      While in a grove I sate reclined,
      In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
      Bring sad thoughts to the mind.

      To her fair works did Nature link
      The human soul that through me ran;
      And much it grieved my heart to think
      What man has made of man.

      Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,
      The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;
      And ’tis my faith that every flower
      Enjoys the air it breathes.

      The birds around me hopped and played,
      Their thoughts I cannot measure:—
      But the least motion which they made
      It seemed a thrill of pleasure.

      The budding twigs spread out their fan,
      To catch the breezy air;
      And I must think, do all I can,
      That there was pleasure there.

      If this belief from heaven be sent,
      If such be Nature’s holy plan,
      Have I not reason to lament
      What man has made of man?

    <h3>
      The Summer Day, by Mary Oliver
    </h3>
    <p>
      Who made the world?
      Who made the swan, and the black bear?
      Who made the grasshopper?
      This grasshopper, I mean—
      the one who has flung herself out of the grass,
      the one who is eating sugar out of my hand,
      who is moving her jaws back and forth instead of up and down—
      who is gazing around with her enormous and complicated eyes.
      Now she lifts her pale forearms and thoroughly washes her face.
      Now she snaps her wings open, and floats away.
      I don't know exactly what a prayer is.
      I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down
      into the grass, how to kneel down in the grass,
      how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,
      which is what I have been doing all day.
      Tell me, what else should I have done?
      Doesn't everything die at last, and too soon?
      Tell me, what is it you plan to do
      with your one wild and precious life?

    <h3>
      To Autumn, by John Keats
    </h3>
    <p>
      Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,
        Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;
      Conspiring with him how to load and bless
        With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run;
      To bend with apples the moss’d cottage-trees,
        And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;
          To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells
        With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,
      And still more, later flowers for the bees,
      Until they think warm days will never cease,
          For summer has o’er-brimm’d their clammy cells.

      Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?
        Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find
      Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,
        Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;
      Or on a half-reap’d furrow sound asleep,
        Drowsed with the fume of poppies, while thy hook
          Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers:
      And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep
        Steady thy laden head across a brook;
        Or by a cider-press, with patient look,
          Thou watchest the last oozings, hours by hours.

      Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?
        Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,—
      While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,
        And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;
      Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn
        Among the river sallows, borne aloft
          Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;
      And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;
        Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft
        The redbreast whistles from a garden-croft,
          And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.
